# Importing & Exporting

Currently, the only way to import an existing project is through Github or a local zip file. However, integration with additional Git providers and third-party providers, such as Gitlab and Dropbox are on the roadmap. For now, exporting and importing zip files offer a convenient means of transfering your projects around without having to use Github.

## Import Zip Archive

To import a zip file with your project contained within, select the option "__Import Zip File__" from the menu in the "Projects" tab.

In the prompt that appears, enter a new project name for the imported zip archive.

After clicking "__OK__" to continue, the imported files should appear in your new project.

## Export Zip Archive

To export your project select the "__Export Zip__" option from either the menu in the "Files" or "Projects" tab.


After doing so, enter the name of the zip file that will be saved to your default "Downloads" location.
